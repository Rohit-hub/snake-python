# Snake

This is recreation of the Snake game that used to come installed on mobile phones (before smartphones became a thing)  
Snake in Python is also the greatest joke that has ever been dreamt up.

## Goal

The player must use the arrow keys to guide the snake along the play area, eating as many fruits as possible without hitting itself or the walls.

When the snake runs into a fruit, it is eaten and the snake will become one segment longer, making it harder to avoid hitting yourself as the game progresses.
